BBBP Explainer is a code to generate structural alerts using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) of machine learning models from the BBBP dataset.
BBBP Explainer means Blood-Brain Barrier Explainer.

The BBBP Explainer framework is highly versatile (coded in Google Colab), with options that can be further developed and optimized by the users: it can accept any user-defined datasets (or datasets available in MoleculeNet repository), can use different fingerprints, data splitters, cross-validation methods, and any classification model from DeepChem library.

There are two codes to analyze the data generated from BBBP Explainer: BBBP(0)_explainer.ipynb and BBBP(1)_explainer.ipynb
1) BBBP(0)_explainer.ipynb explains the fragments importants of non-penetrating BBB drugs; and
2) BBBP(1)_explainer.ipynb explains the fragments importants of penetrating BBB drugs.

The BBBP dataset is provided from the MoleculeNet and DeepChem libraries. It is upload using DeepChem tools. DeepChem tools may also be used to upload any dataset in MoleculeNet or user-defined dataset. 

# Installation instructions

BBBP Explainer is 100% compatible with Google Colab platform developed in Microsoft Windows using Python version 3.8.

BBBP Explainer has the following dependencies: Lime, SHAP, RDkit, DeepChem, Pandas, Matplotlib, sklearn, mols2grid, IPython and XlsxWriter.
